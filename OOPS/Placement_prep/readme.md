- An object is any entity that has a state and a behavior. (Instance of a class)
- A class is a collection of objects. It is a logical entity.

---

#### Inheritance

When an object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability and achieve runtime polymorphism.

---

#### Polymorphism

If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. Java uses method overloading (compile time polymorphism) and method overriding (run time polymorphism) to achieve polymorphism. 

---

#### Abstraction

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. In java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

---

#### Encapsulation

Binding or wrapping code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. A java class is encapsulated.

---

#### Coupling

Coupling is two classes being aware of each other, the knowledge and dependency of another class. Strong coupling -> details of another class. Interfaces provide weak coupling whereas private public and protected modifiers provide stronger coupling.

---

#### Cohesion
