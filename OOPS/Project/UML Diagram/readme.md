#### 1. Use Case Diagram 

```py
4 Components 

Systems, Actors, Use Cases, Relationships.

A system is whatever we are developing : represented by a rectangle.

An actor is someone outside the system which uses the system to achieve a certain goal. 
( An actor could be a person, system, organization and so on) : Customer : External Objects

A primary actor (left of system diagram) initiates the system while secondary actor (right of system in diagram) corresponds to it.
