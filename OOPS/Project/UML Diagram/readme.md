#### 1. Use Case Diagram 

```py
4 Components 

Systems, Actors, Use Cases, Relationships.

A system is whatever we are developing : represented by a rectangle.

An actor is someone outside the system which uses the system to achieve a certain goal. 
( An actor could be a person, system, organization and so on) : Customer : External Objects

A primary actor (left of system diagram) initiates the system while secondary actor (right of system in diagram) corresponds to it.

A use case is shown by an oval shape where we stor the methods and functions that describe each and every function.
Examples : login, check balance, transfer funds for a banking app.

A relationship is the connection between various functions of the app.
Types : assosciation, include, extend, Generalization.

An include relationships shows dependency between a base and included use case. It always happens (Unidirectional denoted by --->)

An extend relationship is between a base and extend use case and may or may not happen depending upon conditions.(Denoted by <---)

Generalization is kind of inheritance where there is a general use case and a specialized use case. We have a choice.
