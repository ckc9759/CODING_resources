Q1 : Write a C program that reads in an integer denoting number of days. It prints 
the number of years, number of months and the number of days that constitute 
the input number of days. For example, if the input number is 403, it should 
print 1(year), 1(month), 13(days). For simplicity: there is no need to consider 
leap years and assume all months have 30 days. [Hint: Use modulus (%) and 
division (/) operators. End of Hint
