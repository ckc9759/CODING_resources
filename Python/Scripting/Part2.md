Lists are mutable
sort()
reverse()
pop(2) - pop at any index
extend() - used to extend the list to accomodate another list's element and not the list as a whole.
append() - append at the last as a list or element depending upon the input.
insert() - insert at any index
```

#### Tuples

```py
Immutable, faster
count() and index() functions, array slicing
```

#### Dictionary
