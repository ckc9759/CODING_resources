### Data structures and algorithms 

---

Data types : 

- Primitive : Integer float Char Bool
- Deriveed : function array pointers reference
- User defined : Class structure union enum

Integer - 4 Bytes
Character - 1 Byte
Bool - 1 Byte
float - 4 Bytes

We use MSB to denote a negative (1) or a positive number (0)

```cpp
sizeof() --> size of any variable 
```

unsigned --> It is used to increase the range of any data type as it does not use MSB to denote the sign of number being stored.
Short --> 2 Bytes
Long --> 8 Bytes
