### Input / Output

---

```cpp
cout<< --> output
cin>> --> input
```

Header file --> include 
using namespace std --> so that we don't need to write it after each line.

If - else --> omitted (basics)

---

#### loops

---

for and while loop

do while loop --> executes atleast 1 time.

### jumps in loops

Break and continue statements

Nested loops --> loop within a loop

---

Thank you
